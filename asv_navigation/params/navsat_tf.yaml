# Instead of using the first GPS location and IMU-based heading for the local-frame origin, users can specify the
# origin (datum) using this parameter. The fields in the parameter represent latitude and longitude in decimal degrees,
# and heading in radians. As navsat_transform_node assumes an ENU standard, a 0 heading corresponds to east.

# If yoour IMU does not account for magnetic declination, enter the value for your location here. If you don't know it,
