# Instead of using the first GPS location and IMU-based heading for the local-frame origin, users can specify the
# origin (datum) using this parameter. The fields in the parameter represent latitude and longitude in decimal degrees,
# and heading in radians. As navsat_transform_node assumes an ENU standard, a 0 heading corresponds to east.

# Delay time, in seconds, before we calculate the transform from the UTM frame to your world frame. This is especially
# important if you have use_odometry_yaw set to true. Defaults to 0.
delay: 0

# If yoour IMU does not account for magnetic declination, enter the value for your location here. If you don't know it,
# see http://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/geomag-web/ (make sure to convert the value to radians). This parameter is mandatory.
magnetic_declination_radians: 0.24836035 # +14.23 degrees in Launceston Tasmania

# Your IMU's yaw, once the magentic_declination_radians value is added to it, should report 0 when facing east. If it
# doesn't, enter the offset here. Defaults to 0.
yaw_offset: 1.57079632679 # IMU calibrated to read 0 at North

zero_altitude: true

# If this is true, the transform world_frame->utm transform is broadcast for use by other nodes. Defaults to false.
broadcast_utm_transform: false

# If this is true, the utm->world_frame transform will be published instead of the world_frame->utm transform. 
# Note that broadcast_utm_transform still has to be enabled. Defaults to false.
broadcast_utm_transform_as_parent_frame: false

# If this is true, all received odometry data is converted back to a lat/lon and published as a NavSatFix message as
# /gps/filtered. Defaults to false.
publish_filtered_gps: false

# If true, will retrieve the datum from the 'datum' parameter below, if available. If no 'datum' parameter exists,
# navsat_transform_node will wait until the user calls the 'datum' service with the SetDatum service message.
