# Instead of using the first GPS location and IMU-based heading for the local-frame origin, users can specify the
# origin (datum) using this parameter. The fields in the parameter represent latitude and longitude in decimal degrees,
# and heading in radians. As navsat_transform_node assumes an ENU standard, a 0 heading corresponds to east.
datum: [-41.401532, 147.120110]
# If yoour IMU does not account for magnetic declination, enter the value for your location here. If you don't know it,
# see http://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/geomag-web/ (make sure to convert the value to radians). This parameter is mandatory.
magnetic_declination_radians: 0.24836035 # +14.23 degrees in Launceston Tasmania
#magnetic_declination_radians: 0.0
# Your IMU's yaw, once the magentic_declination_radians value is added to it, should report 0 when facing east. If it
# doesn't, enter the offset here. Defaults to 0.
